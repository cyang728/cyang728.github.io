The primary objective of Phase I clinical trials is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a new treatment based on the toxicity outcomes. A Phase I clinical trial plays a critical role because it determines the dose level for subsequent studies such as Phase II and III trials. Conventionally, Phase I and Phase II trials are carried out separately.

A fundamental premise underpins the sequential design of Phase I followed by Phase II clinical trials. This premise posits that both therapeutic efficacy and toxicity exhibit monotonic increases in relation to dose escalation. It is noteworthy, however, that in instances where the dose-efficacy relationship deviates from a monotonically increasing function, the implementation of a combined Phase I/II trial paradigm may be more appropriate than the conventional Phase I methodology. The Phase I/II trial will be discussed in the future.

Now, we will focus on the rule-based design also called algorithm-based and up-and-down design. Rule-based designs apply simple rules to allow for step-up and step-down dosing for the next cohort according to the presence of toxicities seen at the current dose level. Due to the simplicity and transparency, the 3+3 design has prevailed in Phase I clinical practice in oncology for decades. Specifically, the 3+3 design has been utilized in more than 95% of published Phase 1 trials in the past two decades (Ji & Wang, 2013).

The 3+3 design sequentially accrued and treated in a cohort of size 3. For the first cohort, patients are treated at the lowest dose level which is specified by physicians. The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
- If no patients experience an adverse event (DLT), then the dose will be escalated to the next dose level.
- If one out of three patients experiences DLT at the j dose level, then an additional 3 patients are treated at the same dose level.
  - If one out of six patients develops DLT, then the dose will be escalated to the next level j+1.
  - If two out of six patients develop DLT, then the dose level j-1 is declared the MTD.
  - If more than two patients develop DLT, then the dose will be de-escalated to the j-1 dose level.
- If more than one patients experience DLT, then the dose level is viewed as exceeding the MTD.

Advantages:
1. It is very simple and can be easily understood by study investigators and clinical researchers.
2. It does not require any parametric assumptions on the dose–toxicity curve.

Limitations:
1. Statistical simulations have shown that the MTD is identified in as few as 30% of clinical trials that utilized a 3+3 design (Hansen et. al., 2014).
2. It exposes an unnecessary number of patients to subtherapeutic doses.
3. The standard 3+3 design ignores the previous cohort. In other words, it only focuses on the current cohort.

Despite the above disadvantage, the 3+3 design has been dominant in Phase I clinical trials for two decades due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. To address the disadvantages, there exist several extensions of the 3+3 design including the rolling-six design, biased-coin design, k-in-a-row design, and its variants. Although most of the aforementioned rule-based designs provide better performance than the standard 3+3 design, they have had limited use in practice.
