## Two approaches to classification:
- **Discriminative classifiers** estimate parameters of decision boundary/class
    - Learn $$P(y \mid x)$$ directly (logistic regression models)
    - Learn mappings from inputs to classes (least-squares, neural nets)
- **Generative approach** model the distribution of inputs characteristic of the class (Bayes classifier)
    - Build a model of $$P(x \mid y)$$ or $$P(x,y)$$
    - Apply Bayes Rule
    - Learns the joint probability $$P(x,y)$$ and then transform it to $$P(y|x)$$ by using the Bayes rule.

The association between Discriminative and Generative approaches:
\begin{equation}
P(Y=y \mid X=x) = \frac{P(X=x \mid Y=y) P(Y=y)}{P(X=x \mid Y=1)P(Y=1) + P(x \mid Y=0)P(Y=0)}
\end{equation}
