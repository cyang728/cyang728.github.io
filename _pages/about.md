I am a final-year PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. My thesis advisor is Ruitao Lin, who works at MD Anderson Cancer Center.

ðŸ“š My research interests include Bayesian early-phase trial design, causal inference, high-dimensional variable screening, and survival analysis.
