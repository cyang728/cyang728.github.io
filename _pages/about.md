## About Me

I'm a final-year Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, working under the guidance of Dr. Ruitao Lin at MD Anderson Cancer Center.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on developing innovative statistical methodologies for clinical trials, with particular emphasis on:

- Bayesian early-phase trial design
- Causal inference
- High-dimensional variable screening
- Survival analysis

## Biostatistics Intern at Merck & Co., Inc.

As a Biostatistics Intern at Merck & Co., Inc. in the summer of 2024, I immersed myself in the critical problem in pharmaceutical research: how to leverage externally controlled trials in current clinical trials to enhance the possibility of acceptance by regulatory agencies. We developed the Data-Covariate-Outcome framework, improving the integration of external control data.
